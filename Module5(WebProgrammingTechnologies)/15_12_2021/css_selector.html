	<h1 id="computer_title">Computer</h1>
	<p class="first">Computer engineering (CE) is a branch of engineering that integrates several fields 
    of computer science and electronic engineering required to develop computer hardware and software. 
    Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering (or electrical engineering), 
    software design, and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering or 
    electronic engineering.</p>

	<p class="second">Computer engineering is referred to as computer science and engineering at some 
    universities. Most entry-level computer engineering jobs require at least a bachelor's degree 
    in computer engineering (or computer science and engineering). Typically one must learn an array 
    of mathematics such as calculus, algebra and trigonometry and some computer science classes. Sometimes 
    a degree in electronic engineering is accepted, due to the similarity of the two fields. Because 
    hardware engineers commonly work with computer software systems, a strong background in computer 
    programming is necessary. According to BLS, "a computer engineering major is similar to electrical 
    engineering but with some computer science courses added to the curriculum". Some large firms or 
    specialized jobs require a master's degree.</p>

	<p class="third">Computer engineering is generally practiced within larger product development firms, 
    and such practice may not be subject to licensing. However, independent consultants who 
    advertise computer engineering, just like any form of engineering, may be subject to state laws which 
    restrict professional engineer practice to only those who have received the appropriate License. 
    National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) first offered a Principles and 
    Practice of Engineering Examination for computer engineering in 2003.</p>

	<h1 id="electronics"> Electronics</h1>
	<p class="first">Interdisciplinary engineering draws from more than one of the principle branches of 
    the practice. Historically, naval engineering and mining engineering were major branches. Other 
    engineering fields are manufacturing engineering, acoustical engineering, corrosion engineering, 
    instrumentation and control, aerospace, automotive, computer, electronic, information engineering, 
    petroleum, environmental, systems, audio, software, architectural, agricultural, biosystems, biomedical, 
    geological, textile, industrial, materials, and nuclear engineering. These and other branches of 
    engineering are represented in the 36 licensed member institutions of the UK Engineering Council.</p>

	<p class="second">New specialties sometimes combine with the traditional fields and form new branches 
    for example, Earth systems engineering and management involves a wide range of subject areas including 
    engineering studies, environmental science, engineering ethics and philosophy of engineering.</p>

	<p class="third">Electronics has hugely influenced the development of modern society. The identification 
    of the electron in 1897, along with the subsequent invention of the vacuum tube which could amplify and 
    rectify small electrical signals, inaugurated the field of electronics and the electron age. Practical 
    applications started with the invention of the diode by Ambrose Fleming and the triode by Lee De Forest 
    in the early 1900s, which made the detection of small electrical voltages such as radio signals from an 
    radio antenna possible with a non-mechanical device. The growth of electronics was rapid, and by the early 
    1920s commercial radio broadcasting and communications were becoming widespread, and electronic amplifiers 
    were being used in such diverse applications as long distance telephony and the music recording industry.</p>

	<h1 id="science">Science</h1>
	<p class="first">The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3000 
    to 1200 BCE. Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural 
    philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the 
    physical world based on natural causes. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek conceptions 
    of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages, but 
    was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age. The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and 
    Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived "natural philosophy", which was later 
    transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century[10] as new ideas and discoveries departed 
    from previous Greek conceptions and traditions. The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge 
    creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science 
    began to take shape; along with the changing of "natural philosophy" to "natural science."</p>

	<p>Modern science is typically divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences 
    (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study nature in the broadest sense; the social sciences 
    (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies; and the formal sciences 
    (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science), which deal with symbols governed by rules. There is 
    disagreement, however, on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical 
    evidence. Disciplines that use existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as engineering and medicine, 
    are described as applied sciences.</p>

	<p>New knowledge in science is advanced by research from scientists who are motivated by curiosity about the world and 
    a desire to solve problems. Contemporary scientific research is highly collaborative and is usually done by teams 
    in academic and research institutions,[35] government agencies, and companies. The practical impact of their work 
    has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the 
    development of commercial products, armaments, health care, public infrastructure, and environmental protection.</p>
