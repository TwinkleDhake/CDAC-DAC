How to use?
Two Ways:

2.Use CDN link

->Bootstrap divides page into 12 columns
->Decides the size components by column
Breakpoints
sm -> mobile/smartphones
md -> tablet
lg ->large screen
xl -> larger screen
xxl -> extra large screen

Container:
->container does not occupy whole page
->container-fluid occupy whole page width

->Create row class div to contain column
->Use col-breakpoint-size property to adjust the column size
e,g col-4, col-6 -> these propety will work on all screen size
col-lg-4 -> for only large screen
col-sm-6 -> for only small screen
