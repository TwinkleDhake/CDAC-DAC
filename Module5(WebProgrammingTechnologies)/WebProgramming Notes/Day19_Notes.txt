React:
Program execution flow:
public/index.html ->src/index.js -> src/App.js
Component:
->Independent block of the page which have its own JS,HTML,CSS


How to Use CSS?
->Create CSS file
->Import CSS file
import 'Path_of_CSS file'
->Here use className instead of class

Importing bootstrap here:
->Copy boostrap library folder in public
->Add link and script tag to import bootstrap inside head tag

JSX:
->Strict rules
->Must close the Tags
->Must have one root/starting tag
->We can write JS code inside {code here} in JSX
->The JS code inside {} must evaluate to something/return something
->If you are passing JS varible or function you must in {}


States:
Example:
a = 10
a = 12 //Here "a" got new state or we change state of "a"
->Variable changes the frontend/UI/ComponentUI is state
->We need a method/function to change the state means change the variable(Because after changing state we have to change/re-render UI)
->Always create state using useState
->State is always inside and only part of that component

//state syntax:
//var [variableName , functionName] = useState(default_value_of_variable)

-> functionName must start with "set"

name=""
name="Siddhant"
setName("Sid")

Notes for input box:
->when register handler function on some event that event will pass event to the function 
->we can access the "name" attribute of tags using "target" attribute of event
